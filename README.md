# Hangman
A word-guessing game using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript

Main features:

- the start and game boxes, together with an additional instruction box and two result boxes (a winner one and a game-over one);
- an array of 10 words to guess, along with descriptive hints;
- an interactive form (works both on button click and pressing Enter; lower- and uppercase-friendly; length limited to one character only; autocomplete function turned off);
- JavaScript: switching between the above boxes, random choice of word/hint, a health points container, a hangman container, a form with a "submitAnswer()" function, "Home" and "Try again" buttons showing at the end of the game, a "Change" button for drawing another word to guess (working the same as the "Try again" button);
- other visual effects: on-hover animated buttons, a hangman picture, skulls-stylized health points;
- responsive design.
